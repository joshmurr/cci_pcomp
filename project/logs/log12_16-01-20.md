## Final Videos

My filming and editing skills are not the best, but the video below demonstrates the features of the headset:

- Boot up procedure
- The lights in the eyes changing as the user looks at the sun.
- The vibration motors triggering as the user moves near or through a wall (if you listen very closely).
- Some of the command line features like turning on the origin axes for the headset, and viewing the data packet being sent to the Arduino.

## Final Write-up

In all this has been the project I set out to do. I have pretty much acheived a working prototype of the initial idea I had, minus a few features, but a good starting point to build upon, or to go forward to a Version 2.

Most importantly I learnt absolutely loads through the duration of the project. 

- I feel more confident with C++ (but aware there is still A LOT more to learn).
- I learnt a lot more about Arduino generally.
- It was a good experience building a 3D engine from scratch, and I would like to do this again but with more features. I think this would stand me in good stead for OpenGL or other more complex 3D work in future.
- Sending data packets back a forth was good to play with and I'm very happy that ended up being a pretty stable part of the project once implemented.
- A lot of Fusion 360 and 3D printing.
- Actually using bitwise mathematics was a good experience.
- And a lot more.

In all, the outcome of the project is perhaps a tiny bit underwhelming, but I feel a lot more equipped now to make a better version of this or something similar in future.
