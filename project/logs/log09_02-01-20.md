## Looking at the Sun

Things seem to be going _OK_... The video below shows that I now have the origin axes drawn, as are commonly seen in 3D graphics. I can also check for the alignment of the heading vector of the headset (for which I am using it's direction along it's X axis) and the "sun" which I have in the top left corner -ish (video):

The algorithm for checking alignment is as follows, which took some trial and error:

```c++
double Object::lookingAtSun(Vec3d &sun){
    // If close to -1 then they are pretty aligned
    Vec3d heading = this->axes[0];
    Vec3d sunHeading = sun - this->origin;

    heading.normalise();
    sunHeading.normalise();

    double alignment = sunHeading.dot(heading);

    return alignment;
}
```
