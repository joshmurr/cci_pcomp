## Software

Putting some time into the software side of things was long overdue! First thing was to convert the flat dots moving around the screen into something more 3D. It's worth caveating myself now by saying now that it was never my intention to make the software side look good... __The whole point of this is to make a distorted and minimal _Virtual Reality_, so my _Virtual Reality_ does not need to look _reeaal_.__

We have been learning a lot about 3D graphics in Mick Grierson's class, from the very basics up to more complex WebGL stuff. My plan is to stick to the very basics using only what I need, but making everything from scratch... :sweat_smile:. Mick showed us that you can achieve 3D effects by simply scaling a 2D image by a factor of it's Z-dimension (an example of this can be seen on Mimic [here](https://mimicproject.com/code/9aa3e672-a3b8-52f5-7c5c-7d7ef75c3f99)). So if you give a third dimension to any point, you can then easily render it in 3D space, and also apply any 3D vector maths on that point. So first thing to do was to make a 3D point move around in 3D space, and render it accordingly. Below you can see just that:

Then I could recreate the example Mick showed us, but in my own vanilla C++:

![Points in space](https://media.giphy.com/media/U1Uo1YBU32YbSkxqpe/giphy.gi://media.giphy.com/media/U1Uo1YBU32YbSkxqpe/giphy.gif)

These are drawn using the following function:

```c++
void Screen::draw3Dpoint(const Vec3d &v){
    float FOV = 200.0;

    float scale = FOV / (FOV + v.z);

    float x2d = (v.x*scale);
    float y2d = (v.y*scale);

    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(m_renderer, 255, 255, 255, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);
    SDL_RenderDrawLine(m_renderer, x2d-scale, y2d, x2d+scale, y2d);
    SDL_RenderDrawLine(m_renderer, x2d, y2d-scale, x2d, y2d+scale);
}
```

I proceeded to flesh flesh out a Vec3D class ([here](https://github.com/joshmurr/cci_pcomp/blob/master/project/main/cpp/vec3d.cpp)) (which is a common thing, OpenFrameworks has a version called [ofVec3f](https://openframeworks.cc///documentation/math/ofVec3f/) which I have referenced, but moslty I used code from a series I worked through a few years ago called [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath/) which explained vector maths and how to relate two points in space quite neatly).

Making the `Vec3d` class was a good opportunity for me to play with operator overloading which is something with `C++` I've not tried yet. So I've replaced the common operators with Vector specific ones, and other vector operations:

```c++
Vec3d(double x, double y, double z);
Vec3d operator+ (const Vec3d &v);
Vec3d operator- (const Vec3d &v);
Vec3d operator* (const Vec3d &v);
Vec3d operator/ (const Vec3d &v);
Vec3d abs();
double dot(const Vec3d &v);
double length();
void normalise();
double dist(const Vec3d &v);
```

With all this vector maths in place, it was quite easy to create a general `Object` class (perhaps a misleading name, but it's what I went with...), which allows me to create `objects` (in a OOP sense) with an origin, points to render a particular object (in a general sense), and location, velocity etc. It was also quite easy with the vecor operations in place to get direction and make things move around, so I created a `follow()` function so that I could make things follow the mouse (which is passed as a `&Vec3d`):

```c++
void Object::follow(const Vec3d &v){
    Vec3d dir = this->origin - v;
    dir.normalise();
    this->origin = this->origin + dir; 
}
```

Below you can see the simplified headset following the mouse clicks, and a _very_ simple room rendered. All these points do have a third dimension, but as all the Z values are the same, it's rendered as a flat image.

The numbers on the left in the GIF above show distances between the points of the headset, and the wall. The `checkCollisions()` function loops through all points of two objects and checks the Euclidean distance between them. If it's below a certain threshold, I could now draw a line between them:

![Lines between points](https://media.giphy.com/media/J34XMJnddqMe1Aj9HA/giphy.gif)

There is of course an error above, in that I was `return`-ing from the function once a line was drawn. I was originally basing this on the `unsigned char contact(int x, int y)` function from the `targets` class which allowed me to effectively return an ID of the collision (which could then be used to reference the correct vibration motor in the headset). But this meant that I could only have once collision at a time. So I changed this to combine all the collision (in a bitwise addition fashion) and then pass this directly to the Arduino from the `object` class, rather than back to the `main()` loop. The function is as follows:

```c++
void Object::checkCollisions(Screen &screen, Serial &arduino, Object &obj, bool DEBUG){
    unsigned char byte1 = 0x00, byte2 = 0x00;
    for(std::vector<Vec3d>::iterator p=this->points.begin(); p!=this->points.end(); ++p){
        for(std::vector<Vec3d>::iterator q=obj.points.begin(); q!=obj.points.end(); ++q){
            Vec3d pUpdate = *p + this->origin;
            Vec3d qUpdate = *q + obj.origin;
            double dist = pUpdate.dist(qUpdate);
            if(dist < 25.0) {
                screen.draw3Dline(pUpdate, qUpdate);
                // VIBRATE MOTORS
                int collision = p-points.begin();
                if(collision < 8) byte1 = byte1 + this->dataArray[p-points.begin()];
                else byte2 = byte2 + this->dataArray[p-points.begin()];
            }
        }
    }
    if(!DEBUG){
        arduino.serialport_writechar(byte1);
        arduino.serialport_writechar(byte2);
        byte1 = 0x00;
        byte2 = 0x00;
    }
}
```

This also means I can keep my `main()` loop a bit more concise and neater. There is probably a better way of storing the byte data to send to the Arduino, but my thinking is that there are two shift registers, so if I store two bytes of data (`byte1` and `byte2`) and always shift two bytes at a time then I'm constantly updating both registers... :man-shrugging:

In the video below you can see it all coming together, as the motors are begin triggered as the headset moves close to the 'wall':

[![Motors triggered](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8zTjoe5SfQI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zTjoe5SfQI)

This could then be extended to 3-Dimensions as all the maths is already in place. You might be able to see that I've drawn in the rest of the points in the headset so it's not just a ring any more:

![3d lines](https://media.giphy.com/media/U3JFzH6UcWUx5KpuDs/giphy.gif)

The headset creation:

```c++
void Object::makeHeadset(Vec3d _origin){
    this->origin = _origin;
    float size = 20.0;
    int i=0;
    int num=8;
    double spacing = (M_PI * 2.0) / (float)num;
    //Main Ring
    for(; i<num; i++){
        double x = size * cos(spacing * i);
        double y = size * sin(spacing * i);
        Vec3d p(x, y, 0.0);
        points.push_back(p);
    }
    // Mid Ring
    size = 12.0;
    num = 6;
    spacing = (M_PI * 2.0) / (float)num;
    for(i=0; i<num; i++){
        double x = size * cos(spacing * i);
        double y = size * sin(spacing * i);
        Vec3d p(x, y, -4.0);
        points.push_back(p);
    }
    // Top
    Vec3d p(0.0, 0.0, -10.0);
    points.push_back(p);
    
}
```

And then a headset moving through space where the `dist` threshold is set pretty high, just cos:

You can see that the perspective of the space all tends towards the top left of the window (`(0,0)`). I think this is because I have no __model view matrix__ or a __projection matrix__ which as I understand it, are important in 3D rendering. It works without this, as the maths is exactly the same. The aformentioned matrices are purely for rendering purposes to make it look better/more realistic. I don't ___need___ this as such. I'd like to implement these and have done [some](https://www.3dgep.com/understanding-the-view-matrix/) [reading](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/3d-math-primer/9781556229114/) into the matter. But this will be a _nice-to-have_ if I have time.
