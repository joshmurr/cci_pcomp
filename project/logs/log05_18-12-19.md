## First, a quick update:

But we'll come back to that..

## Software

Putting some time into the software side of things was long overdue! First thing was to convert the flat dots moving around the screen into something more 3D. It's worth caveating myself now by saying now that it was never my intention to make the software side look good... __The whole point of this is to make a distorted and minimal _Virtual Reality_, so my _Virtual Reality_ does not need to look _reeaal_.__

We have been learning a lot about 3D graphics in Mick Grierson's class, from the very basics up to more complex WebGL stuff. My plan is to stick to the very basics using only what I need, but making everythign from scratch... :sweat_smile:. Mick showed us that you can achieve 3D effects by simply scaling a 2D image by a factor of it's Z-dimension (an example of this can be seen on Mimic [here](https://mimicproject.com/code/9aa3e672-a3b8-52f5-7c5c-7d7ef75c3f99)). So if you give a third dimension to any point, you can then easily render it in 3D space, and also apply any 3D vector maths on that point. So first thing to do was to make a 3D point move around in 3D space, and render it accordingly. Below you can see just that:

Then I could recreate the example Mick showed us, but in my own vanilla C++:

These are drawn using the following function:

```c++
void Screen::draw3Dpoint(const Vec3d &v){
    float FOV = 200.0;

    float scale = FOV / (FOV + v.z);

    float x2d = (v.x*scale);
    float y2d = (v.y*scale);

    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(m_renderer, 255, 255, 255, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);
    SDL_RenderDrawLine(m_renderer, x2d-scale, y2d, x2d+scale, y2d);
    SDL_RenderDrawLine(m_renderer, x2d, y2d-scale, x2d, y2d+scale);
}
```

I proceeded to make a [Vec3D class](https://github.com/joshmurr/cci_pcomp/blob/master/project/main/cpp/vec3d.cpp) (which is a common thing, OpenFrameworks has a version called [ofVec3f](https://openframeworks.cc///documentation/math/ofVec3f/) which I have referenced, but moslty I used code from a series I worked through a few years ago called [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath/) which explained vector maths and how to relate two points in space quite neatly).
