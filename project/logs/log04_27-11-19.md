## Latest CAD Model

I've spent a lot of time in the last couple weeks re-thinking and redesigning the headset itself. The previous versions had various size issues, and generally a rough sketchy design which did not allow for easy tweaking. So I wanted to start again pretty much, but with a better design methods from the start. It was going to __fit me head__ firstly, and also be __modular in design__ so that if there was an element which needed redesigning or improving, I wouldn't _need_ to start again in future.

I also wanted to make it symetrical, smoother, and generally a bit better than the previous versions which had artifacts from the low-poly head model I was using as a starting point.

I knew that I was going to be using the disc-style vibration motors so I could begin working those into the design, so in good practice I made some test prints to make sure they would fit.

No good:

Much better:

And then printed some parts of the headset itself and the new design was starting to look nice!

Again, to make sure everything fits, I printed only half the headset to make sure everything fits and the design works. It isn't perfect, but at least I've successfully made it modular so I can replace parts as and when I need to, and wont need to wait 10-12 hours for the _whole_ thing to reprint.

## The Dreaded Shift Register Circuit

I exercised some very bad design practice with my making of the shift register circuit board, in that I got the bare minimum working on a breadboard and then charged ahead and tried to make the whole thing on one board with two shift registers and components I didn't fully understand. Needless to say, it didn't work first time.

This is the board in the making:

And all the motors having the JST socket soldered on, and heatshrink being used to provide some strain relief on the pathetic wires which come on the motors.

I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was wrong. If I had been testing as I went a long I might have a better idea, but the best I could come up with for debugging was to hold an LED at certain points in the circuit to see if the electrical signals were what I was expecting, and they often weren't! The clock pin should have been short sharp pulses, as in the video below:

But with the second register, I was getting a very bright LED, suggesting it's getting 5v:

I spent some time trying to get it to work, but eventually I decided that there are much better ways to make this thing, so I abandoned it and started again, with a better design practise from the start, as with the headset above. I wanted to make a single shift register circuit __module__ which I could get working, and then repeat it and daisy-chain them.

Here is a potential breakout-board with a 74HC595 shift register, and a LD117AV33 linear voltage regulator to provide 3.3V to the motors and the shift register. The voltage regulator is so that I can start thinking about batteries in the thing, and not have the arduino be the power supply for everything. I would love to get some custom PCBs made, so if I can get this working then I'll give that a go!

This is the first version, with only one transistor __for testing__..

Turns out I was still getting some weird problem where no matter what I did, current would flow through the transistor, even with nothing connected to the base pin. I tried all sorts, flipping the transistor, changing the transistor, changing voltages and currents, flipping the diode. Turns out the diode was the problem. I think it is rated for too low a current, and the current could over power it, or I had damaged it and so would let current flow? Either way when I took it out it worked!

The new modular circuit:

Some more testing:

Out with the old, in with the new!

![Out with the old, in with the new](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49134135331_fbc7a0473c.jpg)

I also made a litle breakout board just for the motor connections, which each have a pin for their respective power, and a common ground for all. There is space on there for me to add a better diode and a capacitor for current smoothing (I think). So finally, I have two shift registers controlling 16 motors! A milestone has been reached.

## LEDs

Next on the list are the LEDs which will go infront of the eyes. I have these 1w LEDs which I will run on 9V I think? So these might run straight off a battery, but I am thinking via a [digital potentiometer](https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/www/doc/datasheet/x9c102-103-104-503.pdf) which I have on order, so I can try these soon. But also I could control it via PWM with a MOSFET I believe, as described in [__this video__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mZS1dwBfY).

Also a lost of code to write, stuff to 3D print, and other stuff that I don't know yet..
