## Last Leg

It feels like I'm home straight of the project. (In reality I'm writing this after having presented on the 13th January and for all intents and purposes the project is done). In it's current state the software is correctly receiving the data from the IMU via the Arduino and so rotates according to real-life movement. This information is used to change the brightness of the LEDs in the eyes to create the effect of looking at a virtual sun. I have redesigned the headset itself slighly with a new front panel, some extra debugging LEDs and an LDR to check when the headset is being worm. Now the power set up is a bit better, the next thing to do was to go through the shift-register circuits with a fine-tooth comb and find out if the Arduino is in fact correctly receiving the data from the software and if the motors are correctly being triggered as collisions occur.

The process of checking each motor and the entire pipline to trigger each motor involed making a single point in the software which the headset would check collision with. Makng the treshold triggering distance quite small and moving the headset around targeting specific points on the headset. I could then feel if the correct motor was vibrating on the headset in real-life. This was a slow process but very worthwhile as it meant I could check my bit-mathematics in the software and all the circuit to make sure the motor in the software was in the correct place in the heaset.

In the GIF below you can see me moving the headset around, and the corresponding data-packet being sent in the terminal on the left. The latter two numbers are the decimal representation on the motors being sent in their corresponding bytes. So the headset has 15 motors, this is in one group of 8 which makes up the lower outer ring, and the following 7 make up the rest. The decimal numbers correspond to the bytes so go up in powers of 2, starting at 2^0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. These can be combined but will never exceed 255, thus creating the combination of 8 bits for the shift-register to understand. If motors 3, 4 and 5 were in collisision, byte 1 would have the value:

```
8 + 16 + 32 = 56
              56 = 00111000
```

The implementation of all this is in the following function in the Object class:

```c++
uint16_t Object::checkCollisions(Screen &screen, Serial &arduino, Object &obj, bool DEBUG, bool all_motors){
    uint8_t byte1 = 0x00, byte2 = 0x00;
    uint16_t ret = 0x00;
    for(std::vector<Vec3d>::iterator p=this->points.begin(); p!=this->points.end(); ++p){
        for(std::vector<Vec3d>::iterator q=obj.points.begin(); q!=obj.points.end(); ++q){
            Vec3d pUpdate = *p + this->origin;
            Vec3d qUpdate = *q + obj.origin;
            double dist = pUpdate.dist(qUpdate);
            if(dist < 25.0) {
                screen.draw3Dline(pUpdate, qUpdate, screen.GREEN);
                // VIBRATE MOTORS
                if(!all_motors) {
                    // Vibrate individual motors
                    int collision = p-points.begin();
                    if(collision < 8) byte1 = byte1 + this->dataArray[p-points.begin()];
                    else byte2 = byte2 + this->dataArray[p-points.begin() - 8];
                } else {
                    // Vibrate all motors
                    byte1 = 0xFF;
                    byte2 = 0xFF;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if(!DEBUG){
        ret = byte1 << 8 | byte2;
        return ret;
    } else {
        return 0x00;
    }
}
```

`ret = byte1 << 8 | byte2;` is a bitwise OR operation combining byte1 and byte2 into a single `uint16_t` to be returned to the main function.

Any way, with all this in place it was time to organise the motors. Below I have been through the process above, changing some connections here and there. By cross-referencing the 74HC595 datasheet I found that everything was behaving exactly as expected. When I sent 00000001, pin Q0 would be powered on the chip, and the rest followed suit. Great success.

With the motors in place, I got the LEDs working. This was a pretty simple procedure. The layout is as follows:

```
[R] - Powered              [B] - Synced with computer
                           
[R] - Headset being worn   [G] - Vibrating motors

                           [Y] - Looking at the sun
```

The blue LED was the nicest result I think. When the software establishes a steady connection _from_ the Arduino (reading data packets correctly), then it changes a 0 to a 1 in the data packet it is sending back _to_ the Arduino. When the Arduino receives this 1 then it turns the blue LED on. Simple! The nicest thing is the flickering before it goes solid blue. This was entirely unintentional. I assume there is a moment where it is almost synced, sometimes gets a 1, sometimes not, which is was causes the flickering. The others are simply on or off as the other function are called (looking at the sun and vibrating).

At this point it is all pretty much done. Following will be a video of it in use and a final write up.
