## Understanding the MPU6050 Intertial Measurement Unit

Addmittedly this is something I've been putting off. But time to tackle it... Fortunately there is a wealth of information online for this ubiquitous Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which should make my life easier.

My starting point is [Jeff Rowberg's I2C Development Library](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib) for Arduino. Jeff Rowberg has written libraries and example programs for many I2C devices, and the IMU6050 is one of them. The [example sketch](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/blob/master/Arduino/MPU6050/examples/MPU6050_DMP6/MPU6050_DMP6.ino) for the IMU6050 is extremely well commented, and comes with a Processing sketch which you can use to test the setup. Getting it going is as easy and plugging into the correct pins and loading the program.
