## The Headset

As the electronics were gradually coming together, and the seperate elements are basically functional. It's time to start bringing this all together on the headset. Here's the last motor test before assembly (video):

The first thing to figure out was a mounting system which I could use all over the headset using the holes which take an M3 bolt. I came up with this plate which takes a cap at either end with a V-groove in it, which will hold the perf-board away from the plate, to allow some room behind the perf-board for the solder and ends of the through-mounted components. The caps are fixed with tiny M2 bolts with captive nuts:

I then got a [model of the MPU6050 from GrabCad](https://grabcad.com/library/mpu-9250-1) and made a simple little mount for that:

(This turned out to be the wrong IMU and the size was wrong, so I made this part a couple times :man_facepalming: )

I get quite addicted to 3D modelling components in Fusion360, so I made my 3.3V regulator circuits, and carried on with the rest, making mounts for each:

As you can see I've 3D printed a stand and the 'eyes'. The stand was very useful as it's getting harder to handle:

I've just taped the motors in place for now (as opposed to gluing them), just so that I can remove them if I need to:

Changing male to female dupont connectors (the crimping tool I bought on a whim ages ago is coming in handy):

I added a two-pole switch for the power from the two 9V batteries which ultimately give power to the motors, becuase I found myself unplugging ang plugging in the batteries which was getting annoying. Plus I had this switch laying around.

And here it is so far.. The perf-board at the front is a common-ground board which everything gets routed through. And the LED's in the eyes are now connected to 3.3V from the Ardiuno and controlled througha transister with PWM. The IMU is also all connected:

And the model:

And finally, the eyes glowing (video):
