## Headset

Version 2 of the headset has now been 3D printed and it's a much better design already. I adjusted the size of my virtual head in Blender which made for a much better fit.

I also added some sticky foam to the inside which makes it a relatively comfortable thing to have on your head. It specific to my own head however, and I have quite a small head. So maybe one day I'll make it adjustable, but I think for the development process I'll just stick to making it for my own head..

Next is to resize it again, it's a bit big over the forehead and the back. And rethink how it actually gets assembled. Rather than it getting cable tied together I want to bolt the seperate parts together, and start rebuilding parts to fit the arduino to and all the various components.

## Vibration

I've already decided to give up on the small vibration motors I originally bought:

[![Original Motors](https://img.youtube.com/vi/K3GfDls8FJs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GfDls8FJs)

And have ordered some of these inspired by Aleksi:

These are going to make design and assembly so much easier because the motors don't stop when you touch them!

## Bitshifting

[![Bitshifting Circuit](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YnUji_EFXYY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnUji_EFXYY)

I made this bitshifting circuit using the 74HC595 chip, and [this tutorial from Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut) which is really helpful. It's easy enough to get the bitshifting working, now I just need to make sure I can assign each output individually, and in combination, which is just about understanding the bits your sending to the 74HC595.

Just as an aside, there's a 10ÂµF capacitor in that circuit which I took from a PCB I salvaged from an old printer a few years ago, and have been holding on to it (along with a load of other old electronics) for a time like now. Nice to finally be making use of this stuff:

I've also started playing around with Eagle to draw out the circuits, because to breadboard a circuit with more than 8 components and all their necessary resistors gets very messy. This is what I think the motor circuit may look like :cold_sweat::

I need to test this of course, I don't really know if it's right.. In any way yet. But if this does all work, the prospect of sending off for some legit PCB's is quite exciting!

## Code

I refactored the arduino serial connection code into a class and took out anything unnessecary which make it's a bit neater to read, and also easier to tie in with other C++ elements I want to introduce. Nice one OOP.

## TODO

* Get the C++ code to assign the bitshifted outputs
* Test the motor circuits
* Make v3 of the headset, and one which I can properly test some of the electronics on
