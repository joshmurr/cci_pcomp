## Eagle

I followed along with the SparkFun tutorial on Eagle and then decided to try and draw out a circuit for my final project. This is what I thought the bitshifting motor circuit would look like with 20 motors:

A close up of the motors:

And then a revised breakout-board with a LD117AV33 3.3V linear regulator, a barrel jack, and I/O pins for daisy-chaining:

I used the built-in Eagle -> Fusion tool to export a render of the PCB. There doesn't seem to be a a 3D model of most of the components so they look pretty basic.. The board looks good though.
