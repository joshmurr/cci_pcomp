## Bitshifting with a 74HC595

> This is something which I had already made a start on outside of class, so my videos will be from my own exploration.

Single shift register counting in binary:

Assigning bits (choosing which I want on and off):

Two shift registers (with LEDs and two motors):

I used this same circuit to control 15 motors in my final project:
