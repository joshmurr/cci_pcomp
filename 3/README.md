Same circuit translated to perfboard:

Just to help me understand the circuit, and prove some assumptions, this video shows the voltage drop across the LED changing as a lamp is turned on and off infront of the circuit. The voltage drop __lowers__ when light is shining, and __increases__ when light is off, as you'd expect.
